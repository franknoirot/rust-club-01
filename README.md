# Rust Club project 01: measure between two points

Just a quick little CLI to measure the distance between two points written for the first week of the @KittyCAD Rust Club we've been having, excellently hosted by @adamchalmers.

I couldn't figure out how to accept more terse CLI arguments using Clap, but I would have loved to be able to accept syntax like `measure --x 20.4,-15 --y 12.3,5.2`.
